# Federated Twin Strategy Tool

This tool lets you combine ("federate") strategies from multiple deployed digital twins into a single new strategy. It generates an AWS Step Functions workflow that collects the current values of the input strategies, runs your custom Lambda logic on them, and pushes the result back out as feedback (either internally or to an external MQTT broker).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Access to the `digital-twin-manager` (https://github.com/cloud-DTs/digital-twin-manager) and the twins you want to federate already deployed through it

## Setup

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Linux/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

## How it works

The tool builds a three-step AWS Step Functions workflow:

```
Collector -> Your combined strategy (Lambda) -> Feedback
```

- **Collector**: gathers the current values of every twin/strategy you reference in `fedtwin.json`.
- **Your combined strategy**: your `lambda_function.py`, which receives all collected values as input and computes a new result.
- **Feedback**: takes the return value of your Lambda and publishes it over MQTT — either to the internal broker or to an external one, depending on `feedback.type`.

To set this up, you need to provide four things, described below.

## 1. Federation input file

For every twin you want to federate, you first need its `<TwinName>_federation_input` file. You get this from the `digital-twin-manager` after deploying that twin — it's exported automatically as part of the deployment process.

Place each of these files in:

```
./input/strategyInputs
```

This is what tells the tool which strategies and attributes actually exist on each twin, so it can validate and wire up the `fedtwin.json` config below.

## 2. `fedtwin.json` — defining the federation

This file describes which strategies from which twins get combined into a new one, and what happens to the result.

```json
{
  "fedTwins": [
    {
      "name": "MicroGrid",
      "newStrategies": [
        {
          "name": "ConsumptionStrategy",
          "pathToCode": "/home/marcocotrotzo/PycharmProjects/SymlCOnv/input/sysml/testLambdaFunctions/fedTwinCombinedStrategy",
          "feedback": {
            "type": "INTERNAL",
            "topic": "Battery/iot-data"
          },
          "strategies": [
            "PV.production",
            "Battery.status"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Field by field:

- **`fedTwins[].name`** — the name of the (virtual) federated twin this new strategy belongs to, e.g. `MicroGrid`.
- **`newStrategies[].name`** — the name of the new, combined strategy you're creating, e.g. `ConsumptionStrategy`.
- **`pathToCode`** — local path to the folder containing your combined `lambda_function.py` (see section 4).
- **`feedback.type`** — `INTERNAL` or `EXTERNAL`:
  - `INTERNAL`: the result is published over MQTT to the aws internal broker.
  - `EXTERNAL`: the result is published over MQTT to an outside broker. In this case you also need a `"brokerKey": "<a key in brokerConfig.json>"` here, pointing at one of the broker entries described in section 3.
- **`feedback.topic`** — the MQTT topic the result gets published to, e.g. `Battery/iot-data`.
- **`strategies`** — the list of input strategies being combined, written as `Twin.strategyName`, e.g. `PV.production` and `Battery.status`. These are the strategies the Collector step will fetch and pass into your Lambda.

## 3. `brokerConfig.json` — only needed for external feedback

If any of your strategies use `"type": "EXTERNAL"` feedback, you also need a `brokerConfig.json` defining the broker(s) to publish to:

```json
{
  "brokers": {
    "default": {
      "broker_url": "broker.hivemq.com",
      "broker_port": 1883,
      "broker_username": "",
      "broker_password": ""
    },
    "eu_broker": {
      "broker_url": "cc673a1ab883421dbfcd225d0e26e925.s1.eu.hivemq.cloud",
      "broker_port": 8883,
      "broker_username": "Test12345678",
      "broker_password": "Test12345678",
      "use_tls": true
    }
  }
}
```

Each top-level key (`default`, `eu_broker`, ...) is a broker profile you can reference by name via `brokerKey` in `fedtwin.json`. `use_tls` is optional and only needed for brokers that require TLS (like the HiveMQ Cloud example above, which uses port `8883`).

## 4. `lambda_function.py` — your combined strategy logic

Your combined strategy must be a Python file named exactly `lambda_function.py`, with a `lambda_handler(event, context)` entry point — standard AWS Lambda signature.

```python
import json
from time import time
from datetime import datetime, timezone

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    kombi_data = event.get("ConsumptionStrategy", {})
    pv_data = kombi_data.get("production", {})
    battery_data = kombi_data.get("status", {})

    pv_power = pv_data.get("generatedPower", 0.0)
    charge_value = battery_data.get("chargeValue", 0.0)

    base_battery_consumption = float(charge_value) * 1.0
    effective_consumption = base_battery_consumption - float(pv_power)

    return {
        "statusCode": 200,
        "body": json.dumps({
            "iotDeviceId": "SwiB9jTPm8kzDXz6chmo5T",
            "time": datetime.now(timezone.utc).strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f')[:-3] + 'Z',
            "consumption": effective_consumption,
        })
    }
```

### Accessing input values

The Collector step puts every input strategy's current values into `event`, keyed by your **new strategy's name** (not the source twin's name). From there, drill down by strategy name and attribute:

```
event["YourStrategyName"]["theSingleStrategyName"]["theAttribute"]
```

In the example above, the new strategy is called `ConsumptionStrategy`, so:

- `event["ConsumptionStrategy"]["production"]["generatedPower"]` — comes from `PV.production`
- `event["ConsumptionStrategy"]["status"]["chargeValue"]` — comes from `Battery.status`

Note that only the strategy name (`production`, `status`) is used as the key inside `event["ConsumptionStrategy"]`, not the twin name (`PV`, `Battery`) — the twin name in `fedtwin.json`'s `strategies` list is only there to tell the Collector *where* to fetch the value from.

### Return value and feedback behavior

Whatever your `lambda_handler` returns is passed to the Feedback step, which handles it in one of two ways:

1. **If your return value has a `body` field** (as in the example above), the Feedback step takes the contents of `body` *only* — without the surrounding `statusCode`/`body` wrapper — and publishes that to the configured topic.
2. **Otherwise**, it publishes the entire return value as-is.

So in the example, what actually gets published to `Battery/iot-data` is just:

```json
{
  "iotDeviceId": "SwiB9jTPm8kzDXz6chmo5T",
  "time": "2026-06-21T10:15:30.123Z",
  "consumption": 12.5
}
```

not the outer `{"statusCode": 200, "body": "..."}` object.
